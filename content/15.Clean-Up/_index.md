## Clean Up

In order to avoid incurring additional charges caused by resources created as part of this workshop, make sure you delete:

1. The AWS CloudFormation stack. Go to the CloudFormation console and in Stacks you can delete the stack that was created. 
2. Also on Confluent Cloud, make sure you delete the KsqlDB App you created as well as connectors running followed by deleting the Cluster itself to not to incur any additional cost.
