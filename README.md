## Introduction

Making decisions in near-realtime is a challenge many of us are looking to solve.  Confluent offers a number of data connectors and simplified stream processing that can make this less complicated and more reliable.  During this workshop you will learn how to use fully-managed **Confluent Cloud** on **AWS** to source historical data into Kafka, use ksqlDB to process credit applications in real time using the sourced historical data together with generated events.  Once our streaming applications is working we will sink the approved and not approved events into Amazon Redshift and finally we will visualize this data using Amazon QuickSight.
